# facial-emotion-recognition

We use a subset of the Facial Expression Recognition Dataset (fer 2013). Specifically, 4 out of 7 classes are selected
and 30% of the training images are split into a separate validation set.

## Kind of Models Included:

- Convolutional Neural Network trained from scratch
- Pre-trained EfficientNet & EfficientNetV2 models fine-tuned on the dataset
- Pre-trained Vision Transformer model fine-tuned on the dataset
