# facial-emotion-recognition

The core dataset is the Facial Expression Recognition Dataset (fer 2013).

## Kind of Models Included:

- Convolutional Neural Network trained from scratch
- Vision Transformer trained from scratch

## TODOs:

- Fine tune a pre-trained EfficientNet model on the dataset
- Fine tune a pre-trained Vision Transformer model on the dataset
